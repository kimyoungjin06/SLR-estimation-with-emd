# Sea Level Rise Estimation with Empirical Mode Decomposition

This repository contains the code and analysis for the paper "Decomposition-based Analysis of Localized Sea Level Rise around the Korean Peninsula using CEEMDAN" (2025).

## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes 61 years of tide gauge data (1960-2020) from 21 stations around the Korean Peninsula using advanced decomposition methods, particularly CEEMDAN (Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise). The analysis reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in sea level rise patterns that conventional linear regression methods fail to capture.
